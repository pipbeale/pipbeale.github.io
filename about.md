I have a fascination with the weird and wonderful in nature, with where science pushes our perspectives in new directions, where it makes us question what we really know, and where reality can be stranger than fiction. I am a biologist having completed a Bachelor of Science in Biology (UNSW 2010), I am a doctor of veterinary medicine (UniMelb 2014), and hold a PhD in Ecology (ANU 2020). Now I am trying to transition my career into biodesign because I am interested in more optimistic, creative and future focused work that blends art, design, technology, and science!


This blog is my documentation for the Biohack Academy at the Waag Future Labs in Amsterdam!
